Concordance
===========

A program that takes in a text file containing English text and produces a list of all words used in the file 
along with the word frequencies and sentence number of the words.

Language used: Java

Run Instructions: 
Change the extension of attached file from Concordance.txt to Concordance.java. 
Run Concordance.java by passing as argument the input text file name along with filepath, as Ppogram arguments.

and store words in a HashMap along with other details. It is then read from the HashMap in a sorted order and printed.
